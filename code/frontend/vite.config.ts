/**
 * sitemap.xml and robots.txt, from design/pages.json.
 *
 * The owner's form offers SEO — "SEO-friendly URLs, meta tags, sitemaps" —
 * and a run that chose it shipped meta tags and no sitemap, because a sitemap
 * is the one part of SEO that is not written while writing a page: nothing on
 * screen is missing without it, so nobody notices. It is also the part a
 * build can do by itself, from a list it already has.
 *
 * design/pages.json IS that list, and it is the only reliable one. The first
 * version of this read `<Route path="…">` out of src/App.tsx and found
 * nothing at all on a 28-page design, because that design built its routes
 * from an array — `{SITE.map(([path, Page]) => <Route path={path} …/>)}` —
 * which is perfectly ordinary React and invisible to a regex. A check keyed
 * on a shape a model may or may not write is a check that is off for the next
 * design. The page list is written by contract: the drawer, the walk and the
 * Studio all read it. App.tsx is kept only as a fallback for a design that
 * has not written the list yet.
 *
 * Only pages a visitor can open. A pattern like /tours/:id has no url until a
 * record is named, and one example in place of eleven products is a worse
 * sitemap than none. Pages behind sign-in are left out as well: a crawler
 * cannot reach them, and listing them publishes the addresses of somebody's
 * dashboard.
 *
 * Host-relative on purpose, like everything else here: the site does not know
 * its own domain at build time, and a <loc> with the wrong host is worse than
 * a relative one.
